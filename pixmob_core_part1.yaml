# PixMob ESPHome Integration - Part 1: Base Config + Lions/Tigers
#
# How to use:
# 1. Add the remote_transmitter component to your ESPHome config:
#    remote_transmitter:
#      pin: GPIO4  # IR LED pin
#      carrier_duty_percent: 50%
#
# 2. Copy all parts into your config

# Required global component
globals:
  - id: ir_transmitter
    type: remote_transmitter::RemoteTransmitterComponent
    restore_value: no

# Shared IR sending function
# Note: Copy this once, shared across all parts
